### About Telecom Dataset

The dataset, provided by Shanghai Telecom, contains more than 7.2 million records of accessing the Interent through 3,233 base stations from 9,481 mobile phones for six months. For example, the following figure shows the distribution of base stations. Each node denotes a base station in Shanghai, China. This dataset could help researchers to evaluate their solution in mobile edge computing topic such as edge server placement, service migration, service recommendation, etc.

### Description of Telecom Dataset

As shown in the following table, the Telecom dataset shows 6 parameters such as Month, Data, Start Time, End Time, Base Station Location, Mobile Phone ID. The trajectory of users can be found by the dataset.

| ID  | Parameter Name      | Description                                                            |
|-----|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Month               | The month when one record happens                                      |
| 2   | Date                | The date when one record happens                                       |
| 3   | Start Time          | The time when a record starts                                          |
| 4   | End Time            | The time when a record ends                                            |
| 5   | Base Station Location | The longitude and latitude of the base station where the mobile phones access the Internet |
| 6   | User ID             | Mobile phone                                                           |

The following figure shows when and where the user accessed the Internet by mobile phone.
