**July 10, 2024**: Our paper “An Empirical Study of Rust-for-Linux: The Success, Dissatisfaction, and Compromise”，**USENIX ATC 2024 Best Paper Award!**

**December 9, 2023**：At 7:39 AM on December 9th, the Zhuque-2 YAO-3 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. It successfully placed the Tianyi-33 Satellite into its designated orbits. The Tianyi-33 satellite is a 50kg class space science experimental satellite equipped with an operating system independently developed by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications—**the Rust-based dual-kernel real-time operating system RROS** (<https://github.com/BUPT-OS/RROS>). RROS will carry out general tasks represented by tensorflow/k8s and real-time tasks represented by real-time file systems and real-time network transmission on the satellite. It will ensure the normal execution of upper-layer applications and scientific research tasks, such as time-delay measurement between satellite and ground, live video broadcasting, onboard web chat services, pseudo-SSH experiments, etc. This marks the official application of a Rust-written dual-kernel operating system in a satellite scenario.

**February 27, 2022**：The second satellite called [Innovation Raytheon](https://www.hugewealthfinance.com/2022/innovation-raytheon-satellite-was-successfully-launched-and-huawei-cloud-heaven-and-earth-was-successfully-networked-for-the-first-time) of Tiansuan constellation was successfully launched from Wenchang, China, at 11:06am on February 27, 2022 (Beijing Time). The satellite carries the satellite-earth integration service compuitng platform including the No. 2 edge service node based on KubeEdge of Huawei Cloud, the QUIC protocol of satellite-ground link, the network function of satellite-borne 6G core network based on knowledge graph, and the satellite-borne 5G core network v3, etc..

**31 October, 2021**:We begin to build the [Tiansuan Constellation](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202111/1237937.shtml)[（天算星座）](https://www.chinanews.com/gn/2021/11-01/9599693.shtml). I am the constellation's chief scientist. The first phase of the Tiansuan Constellation consists of **six satellites** including two main satellites, two auxiliary satellites and two edge satellites, with the first satellite expected to be launched in May 2022.[[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAB72zwbCiE)][[Paper](../assets/TiansuanFinal1203.pdf)]
